PRECEDENCE:
- PRD > Architecture > This TASK

REQUIREMENTS:
- FR-1 (Start/Stop monitoring)
- FR-3 (Transaction-based visualization)
- FR-4 (Requester must be shown as estimated with confidence & evidence)
- NFR-1 (No memory / handle leaks)
- NFR-2 (UI thread must not block)
- NFR-3 (Stable under high event volume)

GOAL:
- Implement MFC-based swimlane timeline UI to visualize VSS activity.
- Lanes: Requester processes, vssvc.exe, volsnap, writers.
- Visualize both point events and span events.
- Enable selection and inspection of events/transactions.

CONSTRAINTS:
- Use MFC only (no WPF/Qt).
- Core (VssMon.Core) must not depend on UI.
- All GDI objects must be managed with RAII.
- Follow Google C++ style and C++ Core Guidelines.

UI_SPEC:
- Timeline is a custom CWnd-derived control.
- Time flows left → right with adaptive zoom.
- Lane headers on the left show process name + PID if available.
- Point event = filled circle.
- Span event = filled rectangle.
- Selected item highlighted; hover shows tooltip.

INTERACTION:
- Mouse wheel: zoom in/out.
- Mouse drag: horizontal pan.
- Click: select event and notify main frame.

THREADING:
- Core emits events on worker thread.
- UI updates via PostMessage (no direct cross-thread calls).

FILES_TO_CREATE_OR_EDIT:
- src/ui_mfc/ui/TimelineView.h
- src/ui_mfc/ui/TimelineView.cpp
- src/ui_mfc/ui/UiModel.h
- src/ui_mfc/ui/UiModel.cpp

- src/ui_mfc/ui/CoreUiBridge.cpp
- src/ui_mfc/ui/MainFrm.h
- src/ui_mfc/ui/MainFrm.cpp

DONE_WHEN:
- Timeline tab renders lanes and time axis.
- Synthetic events render correctly (debug mode).
- UI remains responsive under continuous updates.
- No GDI/handle leaks observed.
- Code builds in Release x64.
- Changes are committed to git.
